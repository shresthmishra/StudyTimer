Study Timer: A Pomodoro-Based Productivity App

A simple Android application that helps students manage their study sessions effectively using the Pomodoro technique. The app aims to improve productivity by providing timed study and break intervals, encouraging focused learning while preventing burnout. This project will also serve as a practical learning experience for our team to understand core Android development concepts like UI design, timers, notifications, and local storage.
